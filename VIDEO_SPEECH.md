# 🎙️ Video Pitch Script & Feature Guide

This document provides a feature-by-feature breakdown and a structured speech script for your 3-minute hackathon demo.

## 🚀 Key Features to Highlight

1.  **The Cinematic Onboarding**: Focus on how the "Goddess of Memory" eases cognitive load and creates an emotional connection.
2.  **Context-Aware Vision**: Show how Gemini 3 doesn't just name the person but explains *who* they are in relation to the user.
3.  **Autonomous Recall**: Highlight the "Memory Nuggets"—automatic summaries generated from background conversation analysis.
4.  **Action Item Extraction**: Demonstrate speaking a task and having it instantly appear on the dashboard.
5.  **Multi-Tiered Resiliency**: Explain the G3 → G2.5 → Regex fallback architecture as a "safety net" for medical critical tasks.

## 📽️ The Speech Script (Time-Stamped)

### **Intro: The Emotional Hook (0:00 - 0:30)**
"Dementia and Alzheimer's take more than just memories; they take connections. This is **Mnemosync**—a multimodal AI companion designed to rebuild those lost bridges. It starts with a cinematic experience, a calm introduction to a digital world that remembers when you can't."

### **Vision: More than Recognition (0:30 - 1:15)**
"At the heart of Mnemosync is **Gemini 3 Flash**. Our vision system doesn't just identify faces; it understands history. When a person enters the room, Gemini analyzes the scene to identify them and provide a 'memory buffer'—reminding the user not just of a name, but of their daughter's recent visit or their friend's last suggestion. It’s real-time social context, delivered silently."

### **Voice: The Intelligent Secretary (1:15 - 2:00)**
"Memory happens in conversation. Mnemosync listens in the background, using Gemini 3 to synthesize transcripts into 'Memory Nuggets.' It automatically extracts promises, tasks, and calendar events. If I say, 'I'll take my vitamins at 8 PM,' Mnemosync understands the intent, Extracts the time, and locks it into the persistent Memory Dashboard."

### **Resiliency: The Safety Net (2:00 - 2:30)**
"Technology must be reliable to be therapeutic. We’ve built a unique **Hybrid AI fallback system**. If our primary Gemini 3 engine hits a rate limit, the system transparently switches to Gemini 2.5 and our local heuristic 'Mock AI' models. This ensures that a critical medical reminder is never lost due to a network error."

### **Closing: The Vision (2:30 - 3:00)**
"Mnemosync combines high-fidelity aesthetics with deep multimodal intelligence. It's not just an app; it's an eternal companion for those navigating the fog of memory loss. Mnemosync: Recall. Reconnect. Reclaim."

## 💡 Recording Tips
- **Pacing**: Speak at a rhythmic, calm pace (this is an Alzheimer's app, after all).
- **Screenshots**: When talking about the "G3 Fallback," briefly show the Mermaid diagram from the README.
- **Demo**: Actually perform the "Scan Now" action during the Vision section.
