# 🏁 Gemini 3 Hackathon Submission Checklist

To ensure your submission is successful and maximizes your "Presentation" and "Innovation" scores, please follow this checklist.

## 📋 Mandatory Requirements
- [ ] **Public Repository**: Ensure your GitHub repo is public.
- [ ] **Public Demo**: Host the build on Vercel, Netlify, or similar (highly recommended for Judges to test).
- [ ] **Video Demo**: Record a walkthrough (max 3 minutes).
- [ ] **Devpost Write-up**: Use the text drafted in `README.md` for the "Gemini Integration" section.

## 🎥 Video Script (Max 180 Seconds)

### Phase 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:30)
- **Visual**: Show the cinematic intro sequence.
- **Audio**: "Meet Mnemosync. For the 55 million people living with Alzheimer's, names and faces become a fog. We built an eternal companion to reclaim those memories."

### Phase 2: The Vision System (0:30 - 1:15)
- **Visual**: Show a face being recognized (e.g., yourself or a photo). Highlighting the "AI Vision Active" overlay.
- **Audio**: "Powered by Gemini 3 Flash, Mnemosync doesn't just recognize faces; it understands social context. It recognizes your daughter, recalls your last conversation, and provides real-time nudges to ease social anxiety."

### Phase 3: The Conversation Memory (1:15 - 2:15)
- **Visual**: Show the "Conversation Recorder" active. Speak a task like 'I'll take my meds now'. Show it appearing in the dashboard.
- **Audio**: "Our hybrid AI system analyzes transcripts in real-time. It extracts 'Memory Nuggets' and actionable tasks. If Gemini 3 hits a rate limit, our system seamlessly falls back to Gemini 2.5 and local regex extractors, ensuring critical medical reminders are never lost."

### Phase 4: The Impact & Wow Factor (2:15 - 3:00)
- **Visual**: Fast montage of the dashboard, holographic effects, and 'Memory Recall' notifications.
- **Audio**: "Mnemosync is more than a tool; it's a bridge to reconnection. Real-time vision, persistent memory, and a resilient hybrid architecture—all built on Gemini 3. Recall. Reconnect. Reclaim."

## 🚀 Impact Score Strategy
- **Potential Impact (20%)**: Emphasize that the "Memory Nuggets" and "Hybrid Fallback" make this a *reliable* medical aid, not just a toy.
- **Innovation (30%)**: Highlight the "Goddess of Memory" cinematic intro as the emotional hook for patients.
- **Technical Execution (40%)**: Point to the Mermaid diagram in `README.md` showing the complex fallback layers.
